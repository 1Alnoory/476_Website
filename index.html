              <p>The system that we will develop is an open source and free system, I mean that users can download it completely with the code.The system is a website for a restaurant that serves fast food, for example, burgers, french fries, and others. Users can go to the site and order through it.</p>

  <h3> The Project is Free and OpenSource</h3>
   <h5>Open-source restaurant ordering and management system that is both powerful and simple to use Note:
     <br> Developed under the terms of the GNU License, this system is free open-source software. Participation is open to everybody.
<br>
There are some limitations which are:
<br>
1- The system will be made using (HTML,CSS,PHP,MYSQL,JS).
<br>
2- The site will be accessed by users, restaurant owners, developers, and restaurant employees.
<br>
3- The project will be completed two months after the start date.</h5>
</div>
  <div class="text2">
  <h3> Developer Guidlines</h3>
<p>
This ongoing document offers helpful advice for software developers who create or contribute to the system.
<br>
The recommendations cover:
</p>
  <h5>
  <ul>
  <li>* Documentation and coding style</li>
  <li>* Links to codes of conduct</li>
  <li>* how tasks are ultimately completed and how developers interact with users and one another</li>
  <li>* refer to https://github.com/1Alnoory/Burgeraza/blob/main/Code%20of%20conducts</li>
  </ul> </h5>


<p>Here every consideration we've listed allows the technical team to collaborate with the executive team to make <br> decisions and guide the process to success.</p>

<h5>
<ul>
  <li>*If you only write code on occasion or outside of the Burgeraza system developers' team, you should read the entire document at least once, but there is no expectation that you will remember everything.</li>
  <li>* If you are a member of the Burgeraza system development team, you should read these guidelines.</li>

</ul> </h5>
<h2>Developersâ€™ Interaction</h2>
<p>All members must adhere to the community's guidelines and documentation. Developers should reach each other through email or MS Teams.
<br>
In any case, these are guidelines rather than hard rules. We believe they would help to streamline our workflow, improve teamwork, and benefit <br>
 both ourselves individually and the "products" that we create as developers.<br>
 The Burgeraza system developers would be delighted to answer any questions you may have about the contents of this document.<br>
 Remember, the goal of these guidelines is to improve everything we produce so that we can say, "I was a part of that!" We mustn't <br>
 lose too much momentum in trying to follow these guidelines.We need to review them if you believe they are slowing things down <br>too much.
 These are not unchangeable facts.
